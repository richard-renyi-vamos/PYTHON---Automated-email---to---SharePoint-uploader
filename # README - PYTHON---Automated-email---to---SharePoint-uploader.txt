Creating a Python application that automatically uploads an email with a specific subject to SharePoint involves several steps. Below is a step-by-step guide along with code snippets to help you build this application. The key components include:

Accessing Emails: Using the imaplib library to fetch emails from your inbox.
Filtering Emails by Subject: Checking if the subject matches the criteria.
Uploading to SharePoint: Using the Office365-REST-Python-Client or requests library to upload the email to SharePoint.
Step 1: Install Necessary Libraries
First, you'll need to install the required libraries:

bash
Copy code
pip install Office365-REST-Python-Client imaplib2
Step 2: Access Emails via IMAP
Below is an example to connect to a Gmail account (you can modify this for other email services) and fetch emails with a specific subject.

python
Copy code
import imaplib
import email
from email.header import decode_header

# Email credentials and IMAP server
username = "your-email@example.com"
password = "your-password"
imap_server = "imap.gmail.com"

# Connect to the server and go to its inbox
mail = imaplib.IMAP4_SSL(imap_server)
mail.login(username, password)
mail.select("inbox")

# Search for specific subject
subject_to_search = "Specific Subject"
status, messages = mail.search(None, '(SUBJECT "{}")'.format(subject_to_search))

# Convert messages to a list of email IDs
messages = messages[0].split(b' ')

# Fetch the latest email with that subject
for msg in reversed(messages):
    status, msg_data = mail.fetch(msg, "(RFC822)")
    for response_part in msg_data:
        if isinstance(response_part, tuple):
            msg = email.message_from_bytes(response_part[1])
            email_subject = decode_header(msg["Subject"])[0][0]
            email_from = msg.get("From")
            
            if isinstance(email_subject, bytes):
                email_subject = email_subject.decode()

            print(f"Subject: {email_subject}")
            print(f"From: {email_from}")

            # If the email has attachments, download them
            for part in msg.walk():
                if part.get_content_maintype() == "multipart":
                    continue
                if part.get("Content-Disposition") is None:
                    continue

                filename = part.get_filename()
                if filename:
                    filepath = f"./{filename}"
                    with open(filepath, "wb") as f:
                        f.write(part.get_payload(decode=True))
Step 3: Upload the Email to SharePoint
Use the Office365-REST-Python-Client to interact with SharePoint.

python
Copy code
from office365.sharepoint.client_context import ClientContext
from office365.runtime.auth.client_credential import ClientCredential
from office365.sharepoint.files.file import File

# SharePoint credentials
client_id = "your-client-id"
client_secret = "your-client-secret"
site_url = "https://yourdomain.sharepoint.com/sites/yoursite"
library_name = "Documents"

# Connect to SharePoint
ctx = ClientContext(site_url).with_credentials(ClientCredential(client_id, client_secret))

def upload_file_to_sharepoint(file_path):
    with open(file_path, 'rb') as file:
        file_name = file_path.split('/')[-1]
        target_url = f"/sites/yoursite/{library_name}/{file_name}"
        File.save_binary(ctx, target_url, file)
    print(f"Uploaded {file_name} to SharePoint")

# Upload all attachments found in the previous step
upload_file_to_sharepoint(filepath)
Step 4: Putting It All Together
You can combine the above steps into a single script that fetches an email by a specific subject, extracts attachments, and uploads them to SharePoint.

Final Script
python
Copy code
import imaplib
import email
from email.header import decode_header
from office365.sharepoint.client_context import ClientContext
from office365.runtime.auth.client_credential import ClientCredential
from office365.sharepoint.files.file import File

# Email credentials and IMAP server
username = "your-email@example.com"
password = "your-password"
imap_server = "imap.gmail.com"

# SharePoint credentials
client_id = "your-client-id"
client_secret = "your-client-secret"
site_url = "https://yourdomain.sharepoint.com/sites/yoursite"
library_name = "Documents"

# Connect to email server
mail = imaplib.IMAP4_SSL(imap_server)
mail.login(username, password)
mail.select("inbox")

# Search for specific subject
subject_to_search = "Specific Subject"
status, messages = mail.search(None, '(SUBJECT "{}")'.format(subject_to_search))
messages = messages[0].split(b' ')

# Connect to SharePoint
ctx = ClientContext(site_url).with_credentials(ClientCredential(client_id, client_secret))

def upload_file_to_sharepoint(file_path):
    with open(file_path, 'rb') as file:
        file_name = file_path.split('/')[-1]
        target_url = f"/sites/yoursite/{library_name}/{file_name}"
        File.save_binary(ctx, target_url, file)
    print(f"Uploaded {file_name} to SharePoint")

# Fetch the latest email with that subject and upload attachments
for msg in reversed(messages):
    status, msg_data = mail.fetch(msg, "(RFC822)")
    for response_part in msg_data:
        if isinstance(response_part, tuple):
            msg = email.message_from_bytes(response_part[1])
            email_subject = decode_header(msg["Subject"])[0][0]
            email_from = msg.get("From")
            
            if isinstance(email_subject, bytes):
                email_subject = email_subject.decode()

            print(f"Subject: {email_subject}")
            print(f"From: {email_from}")

            for part in msg.walk():
                if part.get_content_maintype() == "multipart":
                    continue
                if part.get("Content-Disposition") is None:
                    continue

                filename = part.get_filename()
                if filename:
                    filepath = f"./{filename}"
                    with open(filepath, "wb") as f:
                        f.write(part.get_payload(decode=True))
                    upload_file_to_sharepoint(filepath)
Additional Considerations
Security: Be sure to secure your credentials. Consider using environment variables or secure vaults.
Error Handling: Add try-except blocks to handle potential errors in connections or file uploads.
Scheduling: Use a task scheduler like cron (Linux) or Task Scheduler (Windows) to run this script automatically.
With this setup, your Python app will automatically check for emails with a specific subject and upload them to a SharePoint library. ðŸš€ðŸ˜Š
